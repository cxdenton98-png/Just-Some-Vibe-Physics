# Just-Some-Vibe-Physics

A repo to store tools and explorations of me just 'vibe coding' physics sims and other interesting things.

## About

The tools and concepts here are made by me as a hobby, simulating known physics to build better personal understanding, and frankly, just for fun!

##  Disclaimer

While I do attempt to maintain accuracy to known physics, I am an amateur and am likely to make errors! So take these simulations with a healthy pinch of salt! 

It’s implied in “vibe coding” that LLMs are part of the process, but for clarity:  
these tools involve **considerable** use of LLMs, and that should be taken into account when evaluating their merits.


## Projects

**Relativistic Wave Packet Lab**  
A tool that simulates a 2D Gaussian wavefunction in k-space, transforms it into ψ(x,y,t) using the Klein–Gordon dispersion with toggleable parameters, and two settings for differing k and differing μ(μ=mc/ℏk). There are some issues to address here so it is still a work in progress!

**Bell's Inequality Game**  
A tool designed to express the CHSH game in an interactive and educational way, that shows one of the most surprising results of entanglement!

More to come!
